# SoC-Al-Gore-Rhythmic-Ascent

Welcome! This repository contains the weekly tasks and learning material for the Al-Gore-Rhythmic Ascent project under Summer of Code 2025.
This project is aimed at helping you explore and learn DSA concepts and competitive programming, alongside a project if you want to explore more.

## ðŸ“Œ Weekly Plan

Each week, new tasks will be released in separate folders (`Week 2`, `Week 3`, etc.), building upon the previous work progressively.

- Weekly goals will include both coding tasks and theory concepts.
- Be sure to complete each week before the next begins, as future modules will depend on this foundation.

## ðŸ“… Week 1

We begin with foundational work: implementing a `Vec3` class and understanding the vector math to revise some programming concepts.

Once done, we will start with some theory of basic data structures.
